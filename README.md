# Description
The goal of this project is to implement an emotion classification system that can analyze tweets and accurately identify the emotions expressed in them. This is not just a technological challenge, but one that has significant business implications. By understanding the emotions of their customers, companies can adapt their services and responses in real-time to better meet their customers' needs, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.
# Data Source
The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle and consists of English tweets labeled with six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. Each tweet is assigned a numerical label from 0 to 5, corresponding to the intensity of the emotion expressed.
Our dataset consists of two columns, ‘text’ and ‘label’, where ‘text’ represents the tweets by users and ‘label’ is labeled to define each emotion.
